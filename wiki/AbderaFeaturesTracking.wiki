*Current Status:*
Google Feed Server is based on Apache Abdera 1.0 and has an extended implementation of Abdera Adapters. Managed Collection Adapters, a Feed Server invention, were added to Abdera 0.4.0. Abdera Head is now at 1.0-incubating and release is imminent. When Abdera ships 1.0, Feed Server will sync to it.
