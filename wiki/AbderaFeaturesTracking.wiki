*Current Status:*
Google Feed Server is based on Apache Abdera 3.0 and has a prototype implementation of Abdera Adapters. Managed Collection Adapters were added to Abdera 4.0. Abdera Head is now at 5.0 and this is the only working release. Work is currently in progress to bring Google Feed Server up to date with Abdera 5.0.
