Client tools:
==========================

This is a binary distribution of the client tools (FSCT scripts) to work with Google FeedServer.

The Google FeedServer is an open-source Atom Publishing provider based on the
Abdera Framework.

The home of the project is at:
http://code.google.com/p/google-feedserver/ 

This binary distribution includes the following:
-------------------------------------------------
* The FSCT binary jar under 'dist' folder
* The dependant jars under 'lib' folder
* All FSCT scripts under 'scripts' folder

Instructions before running the scripts:
------------------------------------------
The scripts should be used when requests are to be signed with Google ClientLogin authentication and authorization mechanism.

See http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps.html for Google ClientLogin details 

1. Update the setupEnv.sh (or setupEnv.bat) script with the domain name for the feeds and the other parameters required for authentication and authorization:
  * FSCT_DOMAIN -- Domain name
  * FSCT_FEED_BASE -- The feed URL
  * SERVICE_NAME -- The name of the service with which the user account is associated.
  * AUTHN_URL_PROTOCOL -- Name of the protocol to use for authentication, either http or https.
  * AUTHN_URL -- The end point that handles authentication and grants authorization tokens to be used with each request. 

2. The insertEntry.sh (or insertEntry.bat) script adds a new entry to a feed. 
  The feed entry details come from a file whose path is specified as input in the script : 
  -entryFilePath <path to the file>
  Update this script to refer to the correct file path
  
3. The updateEntry.sh (or updateEntry.bat) script updates an existing feed entry. 
  The feed entry details should come from a file whose path is specified as input in the script : 
  -entryFilePath <path to the file>
  Update this script to refer to the correct file path
  Note: The ID of the feed entry in the file and the input must be same.
